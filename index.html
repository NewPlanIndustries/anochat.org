    <h1>Thanks For Stopping By</h1>
    <p>Right now AnoChat isn't running as it is undergoing a total rewrite. Since AnoChat is a free project this could take some time, so I decided to take down the servers I was running to prevent any costs from building up. I'm sorry if this inconveninces you at all, but I believe it is for the best.</p>
    <p>In the mean time you can follow the development on <a href="https://github.com/scaryuncledevin/AnoChat/tree/2.0" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
    <p>Thanks again.</p>
